### Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: An interpretation of Gal and Ghahramani (2016)

This project was conducted as part of the 2025 edition of the course *Advanced Statistical Inference* at EURECOM. I've decided to reproduce the results from the paper *Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning*, published in 2016 by Gal and Ghahramani. The project consists of two parts:

1. **asi_project.pdf**: Contains the report of the project, aiming to explain key concepts from the paper, how they were interpreted in code and the results obtained. 
2. **dropout_bayesian_approximation.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing code aiming to recreate selected parts described in the paper. 

This repo includes the Jupyter notebook of a code implementation based on the paper. In addition, *notes.md* includes notes taken while reading the paper. This is not part of the official submission but is included as reference material for the code and the report. 

**References**: All resources utilized throughout the project have been cited in the report and Jupyter notebook.
